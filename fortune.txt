# LOTR ---------------------
A wizard is never late, {}. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
Havo dad, Legolas.

Hakuna Matata, it means "No Worries". To find it, you must look beyond what you see.
When the student is ready, the teacher appears.
Any story worth telling is worth telling twice.
Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope. When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connnected in the great Circle of Life.

# HALO ---------------------
Don't make a girl a promise, if you know you can't keep it..
One word for you: Haboodigahaboodiguhguh!

# STAR WARS ----------------
Do or do not, there is no try.
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.
Your focus determines your reality.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.

# RVB ----------------------
Why buy the cow, when you can get the milk for free?
Tucker did it.
Bow chicka bow wow.
Time is not made out of lines. It is made out of circles; that is why clocks are round.
Don't ever. Go. Backwards.

# MARVEL -------------------
YOU GOTTA DO BETTER SENATOR!
Love is a dagger. It's a weapon to be wielded far away or up close. You can see yourself in it. It's beautiful. Until it makes you bleed.
Victory at the expense of the innocent is no victory at all.
Fight! Fight like your life depended on it! Because one day: it may.
Your father lived by a philosophy, a principle, really. He believed that if you could do good things for other people, you had a moral obligation to do those things! That's what's at stake here. Not choice. Responsibility.
With great power comes great responsibility.
A wise king never seeks out war, but he must always be ready for it.

# DIVINITY -----------------
No one has as many friends as the man with many cheeses!
Daemon daemonium, Source Hunter.
One must not mean harm to do it. Please go.
Mashetou na-pathen, sh'danilou! Caomail s'aravel, damerail s'arravel!

# KUNG FU PANDA ------------
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift... that's why they call it present.
If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than who you are.
Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. But if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear.
One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
The true path to victory is to find your opponent’s weakness and make him suffer for it. And to take his strength and use it against him until he finally falls or quits.
Look at this tree. I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time. No matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach.
Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn’t make you who you are. It is the rest of your story who you choose to be.
The more you take, the less you have.
Before the battle of the fist, comes the battle of the mind.
I’m not a big fat panda. I’m _the_ big fat panda.

#WITCHER -------------------
Evil is evil, {}. Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I'm not a pious hermit, I haven't done only good in my life. But if I'm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.
As in life, it is impossible always to be fully prepared for battle. Keep your sword close, and keep moving.
In the face of the inevitable, {}, good leaders should always choose mercy.
For all it brightens, love casts long shadows.
Fear is an illness. If you catch it and you leave it untreated, it can consume you.

#WILDERMYTH ----------------
As the old will tell you: precious things go overlooked in a ruin. What lodges amid the bones of failure is often the dream that drove it.
Day drops, day rises. Dusk is sweet, the sunrise sweeter.

#PATHFINDER ----------------
When in doubt. Save.
No one is inherently good or evil. Only our intentions are.

#JOSH ----------------------

Chocolates are like a box of life: physically impossible.

# MISC ---------------------
All right, I've been thinking, when life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man whose gonna burn your house down - with the lemons!

Every triangle is a love triangle when you love triangles.
Never spend 6 minutes doing something by hand when you can spend 6 hours failing to automate it.

IN CASE OF FIRE DO **NOT** USE THE ELEVATOR
There is no elevator to success, you have to take the stairs.
